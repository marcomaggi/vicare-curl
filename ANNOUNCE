Subject: [announce] Vicare/cURL revision 0.4d1

			      Vicare/cURL
			      ===========


This package  is a  distribution of  C and  Scheme libraries  for Vicare
Scheme,  a  Scheme language  implementation  in  the  form of  a  native
compiler for x86 architectures, officially supporting GNU+Linux systems;
it provides bindings for the Libcurl C language library.

  cURL is a tool to transfer data from  or to a server, using one of the
supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or
FILE).

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

  The latest version of this package can be downloaded from:

	<https://bitbucket.org/marcomaggi/vicare-curl/downloads>

the home page of the Vicare project is at:

	       <http://marcomaggi.github.io/vicare.html>

development takes place at:

	      <http://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare-curl/>

and as backup at:

	    <https://bitbucket.org/marcomaggi/vicare-curl/>

  The last  time the author  bothered to  update this paragraph,  he had
tested Libcurl  version 7.52.1;  however, Vicare/cURL  is written  to be
used  with previous  versions of  Libcurl, too;  the Libcurl  library is
available at:

		     <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/>
