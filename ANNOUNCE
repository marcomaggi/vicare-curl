			      Vicare/cURL
			      ===========


This package  is a  distribution of  C and  Scheme libraries  for Vicare
Scheme, an R6RS compliant Scheme implementation  in the form of a native
compiler for x86 architectures, officially supporting GNU+Linux systems;
it provides bindings for the Libcurl C language library.

  cURL is a tool to transfer data from  or to a server, using one of the
supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or
FILE).

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.
