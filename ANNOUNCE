Subject: [announce] Vicare/cURL revision 0.4d0

			      Vicare/cURL
			      ===========


This package  is a  distribution of  C and  Scheme libraries  for Vicare
Scheme, an R6RS compliant Scheme implementation  in the form of a native
compiler for x86 architectures, officially supporting GNU+Linux systems;
it provides bindings for the Libcurl C language library.

  cURL is a tool to transfer data from  or to a server, using one of the
supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or
FILE).

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

  The latest version of this package can be downloaded from:

	<https://bitbucket.org/marcomaggi/vicare-curl/downloads>

the home page of the Vicare project is at:
