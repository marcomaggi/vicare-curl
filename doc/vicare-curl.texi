@chapter Overview of the package


Vicare Scheme is an @rnrs{6} compliant Scheme language implementation in
the form of a native compiler for x86 architectures, officially
supporting @gnu{}+Linux systems.  @value{PACKAGE} is a distribution of C
language and Scheme language libraries for Vicare Scheme; it provides
bindings for the @curl{} C language library.

@curl{} is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the
supported protocols (@http{}, @acronym{HTTPS}, @ftp{}, @acronym{FTPS},
@acronym{TFTP}, @acronym{DICT}, @acronym{TELNET}, @acronym{LDAP} or
@acronym{FILE}).

The last time the author bothered to update this paragraph, he had
tested @curl{} version 7.27.0; the @curl{} library is available at:

@center @url{http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/}

The package installs a C language library implementing wrapper C
functions for the C language @curl{} library; on top of this, the Scheme
library @library{vicare net curl} exports one binding for each @curl{}
public function; additionally the library @library{vicare net curl
constants} exports one binding for each constant value defined in the C
language header @file{curl/curl.h}.

The following Scheme libraries are installed:

@table @library
@item vicare net curl
It exports one binding for each @curl{} public function.  All the Scheme
function names are directly derived from the C function names by
replacing underscore characters @samp{_} with dash characters @samp{-};
so @cfunc{curl_global_init} becomes @func{curl-global-init}.

@item vicare net curl unsafe-capi
@cindex @library{vicare net curl unsafe-api}, library
@cindex Library @library{vicare net curl unsafe-api}
It exports one syntax binding for each @curl{} public function.  All the
Scheme syntax names are directly derived from the C function names by
replacing underscore characters @samp{_} with dash characters @samp{-};
so @cfunc{curl-global-init} becomes @func{curl-global-init}.

These syntaxes expand to a direct call to the C language wrapper
functions in the @value{PACKAGE} library; they are not meant to be
called in normal usage of the package.

@item vicare net curl constants
@cindex @library{vicare net curl constants}, library
@cindex Library @library{vicare net curl constants}
It exports one binding for each constant value defined in the C language
header @file{curl/curl.h}.

@item vicare net curl features
@cindex @library{vicare net curl features}, library
@cindex Library @library{vicare net curl features}
It exports one identifier syntax binding for each @code{HAVE_} constant
defined by the @command{configure} script, expanding to @true{} or
@false{}.
@end table

After installation, under the directory @code{$libexecdir/$PACKAGE}, a
script @file{compile-all.sps} can be executed to precompile the
installed libraries; for example:

@example
$ sudo vicare \
   --fasl-directory /var/cache/vicare-scheme \
   --compile-dependencies \
      /usr/local/libexec/vicare-curl/compile-all.sps
@end example

This document contains only a brief description of the functions: refer
to the @curl{}'s documentation for details.

@end example
@end defun


@defun curl-version-info-features->symbols @var{info}
Given an instance of @code{curl-version-info-data}, extract the
@code{features} field and convert it into a list of symbols representing
the @code{CURL_VERSION_} constants.

@example
(import (vicare)
  (vicare net curl)
  (vicare net curl constants))

(curl-version-info-features->symbols
   (curl-version-info CURLVERSION_NOW))
@result{} (CURL_VERSION_NTLM_WB

@example
(import (vicare)
  (vicare net curl)
  (vicare net curl constants))

(curl-version-feature? (curl-version-info CURLVERSION_NOW)
                       CURL_VERSION_LIBZ)
@result{} #t

@node plain init
@section Global initialisation and finalisation


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare net
curl}.


@defun curl-global-init @var{flags}
Perform global initialisation for the @curl{} library; if successful
return @code{CURLE_OK}, else return a @code{CURLE_} error code.
@curlman{curl_global_init}.

@var{flags} must be an exact integer representing @code{CURL_GLOBAL_ALL}
or the bitwise inclusive OR combination of: @code{CURL_GLOBAL_SSL},
@code{CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32}, @code{CURL_GLOBAL_NOTHING}.
@end defun


@defun curl-global-init-mem @var{flags} @var{malloc} @var{free} @var{realloc} @var{strdup} @var{calloc}
Like @func{curl-global-init}, but allows the application to replace the
functions used by @curl{} to manage raw memory with supplied callbacks.
@end defun


@defun make-curl-malloc-callback @var{malloc}
@defunx make-curl-free-callback @var{free}
@defunx make-curl-realloc-callback @var{realloc}
@defunx make-curl-strdup-callback @var{strdup}
@defunx make-curl-calloc-callback @var{calloc}
Wrap a user supplied Scheme function and return a pointer object
referencing a callback function suitable to be used as argument in calls
to @func{curl-global-init-mem}; the returned pointer must be released
with a call to @func{free-c-callback} from @library{vicare ffi}.

Each supplid Scheme function must adhere to appropriate prototype among
the following:

@example
void * curl_malloc_callback  (size_t size);
void   curl_free_callback    (void *ptr);
void * curl_realloc_callback (void *ptr, size_t size);
char * curl_strdup_callback  (const char *str);
void * curl_calloc_callback  (size_t nmemb, size_t size);
@end example

@var{user-scheme-callback} is wrapped in an internally generated Scheme
function which does the following:

@itemize
@item
Block and discard all the raised exceptions using @func{guard} from
@library{vicare}; @var{user-scheme-callback} should take care of
handling its own exceptions.

@item
If @var{malloc}, @var{realloc}, @var{calloc} or @var{strdup} raise an
exception: the raised object is discarded and the callback returns the
return value of @func{null-pointer}.

@item
If @var{free} raises an exception: the raised object is discarded and
the callback returns the return value of @func{void}.
@end itemize
@end defun


@defun curl-global-cleanup
Releases the resources allocated by @func{curl-global-init} or
@func{curl-global-init-mem}; return unspecified values.
@curlman{curl-global-cleanup}.
@end defun


The following is a meaningless example of selecting custom functions to
handle raw memory allocation:

@example
#!r6rs
(import (vicare)
  (vicare net curl)
  (vicare net curl constants)
  (prefix (vicare ffi) ffi.))

(curl-global-init-mem CURL_GLOBAL_ALL
   (make-curl-malloc-callback  malloc)
   (make-curl-free-callback    free)
   (make-curl-realloc-callback realloc)
   (make-curl-strdup-callback  strdup)
   (make-curl-calloc-callback  calloc))
@result{} CURLE_OK
@end example

@subsection Easy operations handle


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare net
curl}.


@deftp {Struct Type} curl-easy
@cindex Argument @var{easy}
@cindex @var{easy} argument
Opaque structure type referencing an instance of the C language type
@code{CURL}.

When instances of this type are used as arguments to functions: this
documentation identifies them as @var{easy}.

Instances of this type must be finalised with @func{curl-easy-cleanup};
whenever an instance of this type is garbage collected:
@func{curl-easy-cleanup} is automatically applied to it and any error
ignored.

In certain contexts, instances of this type own the referenced
@code{CURL} value, in other contexts they do not:

@itemize
@item
Finalising a @code{curl-easy} instance owning the @code{CURL} value,
causes finalisation of the @code{CURL} value too.

@item
Finalising a @code{curl-easy} instance @strong{not} owning the
@code{CURL} value, leaves the @code{CURL} untouched.
@end itemize

@noindent
this should happen transparently.
@end deftp


@defun curl? @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is an instance of @code{curl-easy}.
@end defun


@defun curl?/alive @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is an instance of @code{curl-easy} and it
has not been finalised.
@end defun


@defun curl-easy-destructor @var{easy}
@defunx set-curl-easy-destructor! @var{easy} @var{func}
Retrieve or set a destructor function associated to @var{easy}.

Whenever @var{easy} is finalised, either explicitly with
@func{curl-easy-cleanup} or implicitly by the garbage collector,
@var{func} is applied to @var{easy} before the internal state of
@var{easy} is destroyed.

Notice that @var{func} can be used to associate some state to
@var{easy}, for example, by doing:

@example
(define easy ...)

(set-curl-easy-destructor! easy
  (let ((state (make-some-data-struct)))
    (case-lambda
      ((easy)
       (destroy state))
      (()
       state))))

(let ((state ((curl-easy-destructor easy))))
  (do-something-with easy state))
@end example
@end defun

@c page
@node plain easy init
@subsection Easy initialisation and finalisation


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare net
curl}.


@defun curl-easy-init
Build a new instance of @code{curl-easy} owning the referenced
@code{CURL} value; if successful return the new instance, else return
@false{}.  @curlman{curl_easy_init}.
@end defun


@defun curl-easy-cleanup @var{easy}
Finalise @var{easy}; return unspecified values.
@curlman{curl_easy_cleanup}.

It is fine to apply this function multiple times to the same @var{easy}
value: the first time the underlying session data is finalised, the
subsequent times nothing happens.

If this function is applied to an @var{easy} value not owning the
underlying @code{CURL} value: @var{easy} is finalised, but the
@code{CURL} value is left alone.
@end defun


@defun curl-easy-reset @var{easy}
Reinitialise all the options associated to @var{easy}; return
unspecified values.  @curlman{curl_easy_reset}.
@end defun

@c page
@node plain easy config
@subsection Selecting options for easy operations


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare net
curl}.


@defun curl-easy-setopt @var{easy} @var{option} @var{parameter}
Set an option for the @var{easy} handle; if successful return
@code{CURLE_OK}, if @var{option} is invalid return @false{}, else return
a @code{CURLE_} error code.  @curlman{curl_easy_setopt}.

@var{option} must be an exact integer representing one of the
@code{CURLOPT_} constants.

The type of @var{parameter} depends upon the selected @var{option}
value; it can be one among:

@itemize
@item
An exact integer representing a C language type @code{long} or
@code{off_t}.  Whenever a @code{long} is expected: @true{} and @false{}
are also accepted and converted to @code{1} and @code{0}.

@item
A pointer object referencing a callback function.  When a callback
pointer is expected: @false{} is also accepted and converted to a
@cnull{} pointer.

@item
A string or @ascii{} bytevector or pointer object or @code{memory-block}
referencing some data.
@end itemize
@end defun


@defun curl-easy-getinfo @var{easy} @var{info}
Extract informations from an @var{easy} handle; return @math{2} values:

@itemize
@item
If successful @code{CURLE_OK} and a value representing the requested
information.

@item
If @var{info} is not recognised: @false{} and @false{}.

@item
Else return: a @code{CURLE_} constant and @false{}.

@end defun


@defun curl-easy-pause @var{easy} @var{bitmask}
Pause and unpause a session; if successful return @code{CURLE_OK}, else
return a @code{CURLE_} error code.  @curlman{curl_easy_pause}.

@var{bitmask} must be the fixnum zero or the bitwise inclusive OR
combination of the @code{CURLPAUSE_} constants: @code{CURLPAUSE_RECV},
@code{CURLPAUSE_SEND}, @code{CURLPAUSE_ALL}, @code{CURLPAUSE_CONT}.
@end defun

@subsection Sending and receiving data


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare net
curl}.


@defun curl-easy-recv @var{easy} @var{buffer.data}
@defunx curl-easy-recv @var{easy} @var{buffer.data} @var{buffer.len}

@end itemize

@curlman{curl_easy_recv}.

@var{buffer.data} must be a bytevector or pointer object or
@code{memory-block}; it is the output buffer in which received data will
be written.

The optional @var{buffer.len} is used only when @code{buffer.data} is a
pointer object, in the other cases it is ignored; when used, it must be
an exact integer, in the range of the C language type @code{size_t},
representing the number of free bytes available in the output buffer.
@end defun


@defun curl-easy-send @var{easy} @var{buffer.data}
@defunx curl-easy-send @var{easy} @var{buffer.data} @var{buffer.len}
Send raw data to an @var{easy} handle; return @math{2} values:

number of bytes sent from the input buffer.

@item
Else a @code{CURLE_} error code and @false{}.
@end itemize

@curlman{curl_easy_send}.

@var{buffer.data} must be a string, bytevector, pointer object or
@code{memory-block}; it is the input buffer in which received data will

(define share ...)
(set-curl-share-destructor! share
  (let ((state (make-some-data-struct)))
    (case-lambda

       (destroy state))

@node plain shares init
@subsection Initialisation and finalisation of shares


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare net
curl}.


@defun curl-share-init
Build a new instance of @code{curl-share} object; if successful return
the instance, else return @false{}.  @curlman{curl_share_cleaup}.
@end defun


@defun curl-share-cleanup @var{share}
Attempt to release all the resources associated to @var{share}, which
must be an instance of @code{curl-share}; if successful return
@code{CURLSHE_OK}, else return a @code{CURLSHE_} error code.
@curlman{curl_share_cleanup}.

It is safe to apply this function multiple times to the same @var{share}
object: the first time the data is finalised, the subsequent times
nothing happens.

@strong{NOTE} When this function actually finalises a @code{CURLSH}
object the registered callbacks may be called; be careful not to release
them before finalising @var{share}.
@end defun

@node plain shares opts
@subsection Registering in shares


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare net
curl}.


@defun curl-share-setopt @var{share} @var{option} @var{parameter}
Set @var{option} to @var{parameter} for the given @var{share}; if
succesful return @code{CURLSHE_OK}, else return a @code{CURLSHE_} error
code.  @curlman{curl_share_setopt}.

@var{option} must be an exact integer representing a @code{CURLSHOPT_}
constant.

The type of @var{parameter} depends on @var{option}.  Whenever the
@var{option} requires a pointer value: @var{parameter} can be either a
pointer object or @false{}, which will be converted to @cnull{}.

@subsection Preparing callback functions


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare net
curl}.


@defun make-curl-lock-function @var{user-scheme-function}
Wrap a user supplied Scheme function and return a pointer object
referencing a callback function suitable to be used as @var{parameter}
argument in calls to @func{curl-share-setopt} with @var{option} set to
@code{CURLSHOPT_LOCKFUNC}; the returned pointer must be released with a
call to @func{free-c-callback} from @library{vicare ffi}.

@var{user-scheme-function} must accept @math{4} arguments:

@enumerate
@item
A temporary instance of @code{curl-easy} @strong{not} holding ownership
for the wrapped @code{CURL} instance.

@item
An exact integer representing a @code{CURL_LOCK_DATA_} constant.

@item
An exact integer representing a @code{CURL_LOCK_ACCESS_} constant.

@item
A copy of the value registered in the associated @var{share} with the
@var{option} @code{CURLSHOPT_USERDATA}; this is @false{} or a pointer
object.
@end enumerate

@var{user-scheme-callback} can return unspecified values.

@var{user-scheme-callback} is wrapped in an internally generated Scheme
function which does the following:

@itemize
@item
Whatever value is returned by @var{user-scheme-callback} it is discarded
and @code{(void)} is returned instead.

@item
Block and discard all the raised exceptions using @func{guard} from
@library{vicare}; @var{user-scheme-callback} should take care of
handling its own exceptions.

@item
If @var{user-scheme-callback} raises an exception: the raised object is
discarded and the callback returns @code{(void)}.
@end itemize
@end defun


@defun make-curl-unlock-function @var{user-scheme-function}
Wrap a user supplied Scheme function and return a pointer object
referencing a callback function suitable to be used as @var{parameter}
argument in calls to @func{curl-share-setopt} with @var{option} set to
@code{CURLSHOPT_UNLOCKFUNC}; the returned pointer must be released with
a call to @func{free-c-callback} from @library{vicare ffi}.

@var{user-scheme-function} must accept @math{3} arguments:

@enumerate
@item
A temporary instance of @code{curl-easy} @strong{not} holding ownership
for the wrapped @code{CURL} instance.

@item
An exact integer representing a @code{CURL_LOCK_DATA_} constant.

@item
A copy of the value registered in the associated @var{share} with the
@var{option} @code{CURLSHOPT_USERDATA}; this is @false{} or a pointer
object.
@end enumerate

@var{user-scheme-callback} can return unspecified values.

@var{user-scheme-callback} is wrapped in an internally generated Scheme
function which does the following:

@subsection Miscellaneous shares functions


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare net
curl}.


@defun curl-share-strerror @var{errcode}
@defunx curl-share-strerror/string @var{errcode}
Given an exact integer representing a @code{CURLSHE_} error code return
an @ascii{} bytevector or string describing the associated error.
@curlman{curl_share_strerror}.
@end defun

@section Miscellaneous functions


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare net
curl}.


@defun curl-free @var{pointer}
Release memory allocated through a call to the @curl{} library; return
unspecified values.  @curlman{curl_free}.

@var{pointer} must be @false{} or a pointer object; when @var{pointer}
is neither @false{} nor @cnull{}: @var{pointer} is mutated to represent
the @cnull{} pointer.

It is safe to apply this function multiple times to the same
@var{pointer}.
@end defun


@defun curl-escape @var{str.data}
@defunx curl-escape @var{str.data} @var{str.len}
Obsolete function.  Escape all the characters in the input string to
make it ready to be a @aurl{} component; if successful return a
bytevector holding the @ascii{} encoding of the string, else return
@false{}.  @curlman{curl_escape}.

@var{str.data} must be a string, bytevector, pointer object or
@code{memory-block} holding the representation of an @ascii{} string.

The optional @var{str.len} must be @false{} or an exact integer, in the
range of the C language type @code{int}, representing the number of
bytes in the input string; when @false{} or not given, the length of the
string is determined with @cfunc{strlen}.  @var{str.len} is always
ignored but when @var{str.data} is a pointer object.
@end defun


@defun curl-escape/string @var{str.data}
@defunx curl-escape/string @var{str.data} @var{str.len}
Like @func{curl-escape} but return a Scheme string.
@end defun


@defun curl-unescape @var{str.data}
@defunx curl-unescape @var{str.data} @var{str.len}
Obsolete function.  Unescape all the characters in the input string as
if it comes from a @aurl{} component; if successful return a bytevector
holding the @ascii{} encoding of the string, else return @false{}.
@curlman{curl_unescape}.

@var{str.data} must be a string, bytevector, pointer object or
@code{memory-block} holding the representation of an @ascii{} string.

The optional @var{str.len} must be @false{} or an exact integer, in the
range of the C language type @code{int}, representing the number of
bytes in the input string; when @false{} or not given, the length of the
string is determined with @cfunc{strlen}.  @var{str.len} is always
ignored but when @var{str.data} is a pointer object.
@end defun


@defun curl-unescape/string @var{str.data}
@defunx curl-unescape/string @var{str.data} @var{str.len}
Like @func{curl-unescape} but return a Scheme string.
@end defun


@defun curl-getdate @var{date}
Convert a date string to the the number of seconds since the Epoch.
@curlman{curl_getdate}.

@var{str.data} must be a string, bytevector, pointer object or
@code{memory-block} holding the representation of the date as @ascii{}
string.

@example
(import (vicare)
  (vicare net curl))

(curl-getdate "Sun Nov 6 94")
@result{} 784080000
@end example
@end defun

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@defunx curl-sockaddr.addrlen @var{pointer}
@defunx curl-sockaddr.addr @var{pointer}
Given a pointer to a @code{struct curl_sockaddr}, return the value of
each field in such structure.  All the functions return an exact
integer, but @func{curl-sockaddr.addr} which returns a bytevector
holding the whole @code{struct sockaddr} field.
