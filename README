1. Introduction
---------------

This package is a distribution of C and Scheme libraries for
Vicare Scheme,  an R6RS compliant Scheme  implementation; it
provides bindings for the Libcurl C language library.

  cURL is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using
one  of the  supported  protocols (HTTP,  HTTPS, FTP,  FTPS,
TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE).

  The  last   time  the  author  bothered   to  update  this
paragraph, he had tested Libcurl version 7.27.0.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

3. Install
----------

Before installing Vicare/cURL make  sure to have a correctly
installed Libcurl library.  To install Vicare/cURL do this:

   $ cd vicare-curl-0.1.0
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make check
   $ make install

notice  that the  "configure" script  is prepared  to enable
shared libraries and disable static libraries: this must not
be  changed, because  the package  is meant  to install  a C
shared library to be dynamically loaded.

  Notice that to  successfully run the test suite  we do not
need to  be connected to the  Net.  Additional demonstration
tests are in the "tests/demo-*.sps"  files, and to run those
we must  be connected  to the  Internet, because  some tests
access the following URLs:

    http://google.com/
    https://github.com/

to run the demonstrations do:

    $ make demo

and expect a lot of output.

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/vicare-curl

  After  installation, the  makefile rule  "vfasl-installed"
will  precompile the  libraries installed  in the  hierarchy
(vicare curl ---); the makefile rule "installcheck" will run
the test suite against the installed libraries.


4. Usage
